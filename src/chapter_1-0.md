[_**Wizard Amigos**_](http://wizardamigos.com) is an open-source javascript e-learning project started in 2015 by [Nina Breznik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ninabreznik/) and [Alexander Praetorius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-praetorius-9355b751/), at first as a coding school for kids and refugees in Germany, but which has grown since, and has extended to all the people who want to learn how to program, start their own company and, why not, travel the world, by becoming a cyber nomad, by following their founders' path.

This guide wants to be a point of reference for both beginners and andvanced programmers, wanting to learn how to start and run their own company.

You are very welcome to stop by and say hello to the Wizard Amigos community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/wizardamigosinstitute/program)!
