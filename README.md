# The Wizard Amigos Guide

To know more about the project, please visit the [Wizard Amigos website](http://wizardamigos.com/).

## How to collaborate

The _Wizard Amigos Guide_ is built with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook), an open-source tool to write documentations in markdown which is then magically transformed into html/css/js.

For a complete guide on how to use mdBook, please have a look at the [mdBook User Guide](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/).
