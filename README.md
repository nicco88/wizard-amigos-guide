# The Wizard Amigos Guide

To know more about the project, please visit the [Wizard Amigos website](http://wizardamigos.com/).

## How to collaborate

The _Wizard Amigos Guide_ is built with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook), an open-source tool to write documentations in markdown which is then magically transformed into html/css/js.

For a complete guide on how to use mdBook, please have a look at the [mdBook User Guide](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/).

In order to be able to use mdBook, you have to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) first (at least version 1.20).

Copy the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

After Rust has been installed, please install mdBook:

```sh
cargo install mdbook
```

Now clone the repository locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nicco88/wizard-amigos-guide.git
```
